```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```



```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb|>
  mutate(stars=review_scores_location/2) |>
  select(
    price, stars, borough = neighbourhood_group,
    neighbourhood, room_type) |>
  filter(borough != "Staten Island")

```

Let's fit a model

```{r}
fit = 
  nyc_airbnb |>
  lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = _)
```


Let's look at the `fit`

```{r}
fit
summary(fit)
```
